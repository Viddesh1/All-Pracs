
Aim: Demonstrate the Accessing and wing and performing CRUD operation in
1. HBase
2. Apache Cassandra

Background Information
HBase
 is an open-source non-relational distributed database modeled after Google's Bigtable and written in Java. It is developed as part of Apache Software Foundation's Apache Hadoop project and runs on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) or Alluxio, providing Bigtable-like capabilities for Hadoop. That is, it provides a fault- tolerant way of storing large quantities of sparse data (small amounts of information caught within a large collection of empty or unimportant data, such as finding the 50 largest items in a group of 2 billion records or finding the non-zero items representing less than 0.1% of a huge collection).


Apache Cassandra:

Cassandra is a five and open-source, distributed, wide-column store, NoSQL database manager with designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra offers support for chatrs spanning multiple datacenters with masterless replication allowing low latency operations for all clients, Cassandra was designed to impl combination of Amazon's Dynamo distributed stotage and replication techniques combined with Google's Bigtable

Create Operation

data and storage engine model. The create or insert operations are used to insert or add new documents in the collection. If collection does not exist, then it will create a new collection in the database

Read Operation:

The Read operations are used to retrieve documents from the collection, or in other words, read operations

to query a collection for a document

Update Operation:

The update operations are used to update or modify the existing document in the collection

Delete Operation:

The delete operation is used to delete or remove documents from a collection
